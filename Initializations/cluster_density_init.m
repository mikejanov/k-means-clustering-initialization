% cluster_density_init.m
% This function handles integration of all k-means clustering functions.
%   Initialization Function 3: Density
%
% See original paper:
%   Q. Yuan, H. Shi and X. Zhou, "An optimized initialization center
%       K-means clustering algorithm based on density," 2015 IEEE
%       International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation,
%       Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER), Shenyang, 2015,
%       pp. 790-794.

% Note: This is not a fully-faithful remaking of Q. Yuan, et al's,
%   algorithm. There were some difficulties understanding Minimum Density
%   Distance (MDD) in the paper and some conflicting statements that led me
%   to leave this portion out. Instead, filtering was done by local-radius
%   filtering rather than by the proposed MDD. Radius size is a critical
%   portion of this algorithm that was not well-addressed in the paper and
%   I currently have a hard-coded value for local radius size that works
%   sufficiently well for my data sets.
%
%   Variables and Notation:
%       d = number of dimentions
%       k = number of clusters
%       mu = centroid of a given class cluster
%
%   <--[final_mus] Selected mus as centroids for clusters. (k x d) matrix.
%   <--[labels] Assigned class (from 1 to k) of each data point.
%               (data_num_row x 1) matrix.
%   <--[time] Execution systime of each iteration. (1 x num_restarts)
%   <--[iterations] Number of 'true means' iterations until convergence.
%   -->[num_k_means] The number of mus that are in the data set.
%   -->[data] (row x d) data set to classify.
